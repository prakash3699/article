	  <p><b>India is an agrarian country with around 60% of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. Recent data shows that an average farm household makes around Rs 20,000 a year from agriculture. Therefore most of the agriculture households are in Debt. As per records average loan amount outstanding per household is above Rs 50,000.</b>
	  
	  The small and marginal farmer or "Annadata” faces multiple challenges including debt, drought, crop failure, and inability to access markets.
	  ur Model is designed to help farmers overcome these problems without subsidy.
	  Currently we are working with Groundnut farmers of Anantpur, Mango farmers of Chittoor and Red gram, Cotton, Soya farmers of Adilabad and Yavatmal. We have reached out to over 31,000 farmers at present and help them to cut costs, improve yields and significantly increase net incomes through value addition and better marketing. As we scale our activities we hope to help both farmers and consumers.</p><br>

	 <p><aside><strong>The Bharat Jodo Yatra will cover a distance of 3,570 km by next year. It is the longest march on foot by any Indian politician in the history of India, the Congress had claimed earlier. Rahul Gandhi aims to mobilise the party cadre and unite the general public against the alleged "divisive politics in the country"Assembly member H.V. Kamath proposed that ‘Pradeshas’ be used instead of  ‘States’ in order to avoid confusion, since the word ‘States’ had been used with different meanings throughout the Draft Constitution.

	 Some members argued that the word ‘Provinces’ be used because ‘States’ indicated imitation and was used in the Constitution of the USA. They also felt that the word ‘States’ has a bad connotation because of its association with the ‘Indian States’ during British rule.

	 Mahavir Tyagi argued that ‘States’ be replaced with ‘Republican States’ and the phrase “the sovereignty of the Union shall reside in the whole body of the people” be added to emphasise that sovereignty resided with everyone and not just the king, as it did during British times.Assembly member K.T.  Shah proposed that the phrase “Secular, Federal, Socialist Union of States” be added to Article 1 to delineate the political character of India. However,<mark> Dr. B.R. Ambedkar argued that the policy of the state and how society should be organised – socially, economically – must be decided by the people themselves, according to the time and circumstances, and cannot be specified in the Constitution.</mark> Further, he said that the amendment is unnecessary because there were other sections in the Constitution that covered the principles of state policy.

	 Some members of the Assembly proposed that a clause be added to Article 1, stating that 10 years after the Constitution comes into force, member States of the Union of India should be organised on a uniform basis, by groups of village panchayats that would function as democratic units. However, this amendment was rejected.

	 K.T. Shah proposed that, in Article 1, after the word ‘States’, the words ‘equal inter se’ be added to emphasise the political unity of States despite the existing natural, social and political inequality among them. H.V. Kamath and M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar argued that such equality between ‘States’ already existed in certain parts of the Constitution (Part I of the First Schedule) and that the States were represented in the Lower and Upper Houses of Parliament based on their population.</strong></aside></p>

	<p><small>Ecological degradation is one of the root causes for global poverty, often felt strongest among smallholder farmers and indigenous people. Well-designed agroforestry focused on social impact offers farming communities food security and access to value chains for forest and food products. At the beginning of 2019, Commonland embarked on an ambitious landscape restoration project in central India. Funded by the IKEA Foundation, TNC India and Commonland aim to catalyse agroforestry at scale by providing smallholder farmers with technical assistance and access to resources, to develop sustainable local institutions and build linkages to markets for their forest and agroforest products.</p>
